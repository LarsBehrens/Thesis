	Abstract = {Malicious software (malware) is a computer program designed to create harmful and undesirable effects.
    It considered as one of the many dangerous threats for Internet users. Rootkit, botnet, worm, spyware
    and Trojan horse are the most common types of malware. Most malware studies aim to investigate novel
    approaches of preventing, detecting and responding to malware threats. However, despite the many
    articles published to support the research activities, there is still no trace of any bibliometric report that
    demonstrates the research trends. This paper aims to fill in that gap by presenting a comprehensive
    evaluation of malware research practices. It begins by looking at a pool of over 4000 articles that are
    published between 2005 and 2015 in the ISI Web of Science database. Using bibliometric analysis, this
    paper discusses the research activities done in both North America, Asia and other continents. This paper
    performed a detailed analysis by looking at the number of articles published, citations, research area,
    keywords, institutions, terms, and authors. A summary of the research activities continues by listing the
    terms into a classification of malware detection system which underlines the important area of malware
    research. From the analysis, it was concluded that there are several significant impacts of research activities
    in Asia, in comparison to other continents. In particular, this paper discusses the number of
    papers published by Asian countries such as China, Korea, India, Singapore and Malaysia in relation to the
    Middle East and North America.},

	Abstract = {Malware is a worldwide epidemic. Studies suggest that the impact of malware
    is getting worse. Malware detectors are the primary tools in defense against malware.
    The quality of such a detector is determined by the techniques it uses. It is
    therefore imperative that we study malware detection techniques and understand
    their strengths and limitations. This survey examines 45 malware detection techniques
    and offers an opportunity to compare them against one another aiding in
    the decision making process involved with developing a secure application/system.
    The survey also provides a comprehensive bibliography as an aid to researchers
    in malware detection.},
